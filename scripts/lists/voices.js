		'Nasally voice. Takes deep breaths every few sentences.',
		'Rarely speaks, but has little volume control.',
		'This person seems to purr their words more than a tabaxi. You don\'t think they\'re trying to be sexy but you do have the urge to rub their belly.',
		'This person is definitely trying to sound deep and tough for the Adventurers. This facade is betrayed by the few squawks and squeaks they cannot surpress.',
		'This old lady bubbles and tittles like a babbling brook. Her constant giggles sound like a stream passing over stones.',

		'Sometime repeats a word in their sentences like a skaven',
		'Speaks without using Contractions (ie can\'t, won\'t, I\'m)',
		'speaks in a morbid, dark tone. Tends to enunciate words in order to enhance their dramatic appeal.',
		'Clears throat waaaayyyy too much',
		'Speaks without emotion, but announces what emotion he would be speaking with.',
		'Slow, deep and cold. Conjures images of the watery depths below an ice shelf. (Best coupled with a hard unblinking stare directly at the player they are speaking to)',

		'Slight lisp, more pronounced in certain situations (stress, foreign language, fear).',
		'Is mock-offended very frequently; exaggerated gasps and a hand to his chest.',
		'Voice is very "bouncy", with strong pitch changes in each word or phrase. Exaggeration of typical variation.',
		'Uses old-fashioned interjections: Gee-golly! By my stars! Landâ€™s sake! Zounds! Hark! Cripes!',
		'You can hear their smile in their words. Although they\'re a stranger to you, they speak to you with the easy familiarity of a friend.',
		'Constant quick-talker. It\'s like their mouth is struggling to keep up with their racing mind.',
		'Every sentence seethes with barely-contained outrage. They\'re not necessarily angry at you; they\'re angry at the whole world, and that anger comes across in their voice.',
		'Constantly cuts you off, because they\'re arrogant, rude, and a terrible listener. (This one will likely annoy your players, so use cautiously.)',
		'Speaks in a lazy drawl and enunciates in an exaggerated manner. It\'s like they think words are delicious, so they savor every one.',
